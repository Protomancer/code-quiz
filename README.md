# code-quiz

# This was another very challenging project, i couldnt get a reset function placed into the code and I aslo couldnt figure out how to link to another page. instead just to have a working display I placed the score on into a container on the page. I also could not get the reset button to work whatsoever. I removed it from the document and im going to have to come back to that.

## The intended function of this project is to run a timed test of four questions or more using the time remaining at the end as the score. I was able to (with help of my teacher,tutor,TA and several other students) get the test starting. If you hit the green start button the timer starts and the questions are displayed. You can click on the questions and run through the test but it doesnt reset at the end. It does locally store the score and display it on page with the users initials. I will be coming back to the project to try and come up with the solutions.
